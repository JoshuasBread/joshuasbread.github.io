                                        <u>The Cut:</u> Split the loaf in half, lean forward, and breathe in deeply. Cut
                                        slices
                                        from the middle outwards. The middle slices are conveniently large, and you
                                        enjoy
                                        the
                                        fluffy center of he bread when it's freshest.<br><br>
                                        <u>Day 1:</u> Place the two loaf halves cut-side-down on the
                                        cutting board. Eat a slice whenever you walk by.<br><br>
                                        <u>Day 2:</u> Bread should still be fresh. Toasting is
                                        optional.<br><br>
                                        <u>Days 3-7:</u> If there's any loaf left, store it in a paper or
                                        plastic bag. Rub a touch of
                                        water on your slice and toast it. Be impressed that this actually makes a
                                        difference.<br><br>
                                        Breads can be frozen in an airtight bag for several months. Slice the loaf
                                        first, or
                                        freeze it whole.<br><br>
                                        Refrigeration dries out bread and is not recommended.

                                        Naturally leavened (sourdough) bread can keep at room temperature for at least a
                                        week.
                                        Frozen bread keeps for several months.<br><br>
                                        The bacteria present in a sourdough starter produce acids during a thorough
                                        fermentation
                                        process. These acids act as a natural preservative. They're also the “sour”
                                        flavor in
                                        sourdough.<br><br>
                                        In commercially yeasted breads, these bacterial cultures are not present, so
                                        alternative
                                        preservatives must be added.

                                        <li>It is made simply and with high-quality ingredients.</li>
                                        <li>Thorough fermentation breaks down flour starches and
                                            untangles knotted proteins.</li>
                                        <li>High hydration (water content) softens the dough and activates enzymes that break down starch and protein even further.</li>
                                        <li>A long, hot bake ensures that starches are gelatinized and gluten
                                            proteins fully cooked.</li>

                                        These last 3 reasons result in a loaf that is easy to digest. Many people who
                                        feel
                                        lethargic or heavy after eating other breads have reported that this bread does
                                        not
                                        bother their system.<br><br>
                                        Commercial and grocery-store breads often contain added preservatives and dough
                                        conditioners, are fermented rapidly or not at all, have a lower water content,
                                        and
                                        are
                                        not completely cooked. When you eat them, the flour has not been sufficiently
                                        broken
                                        down, and your stomach pays the price.

                                <div class="response">
                                    <p><br>Sourdough is bread made using a fermented water-and-flour
                                        mixture (called a natural leaven, or starter) instead of commercial yeast. It is
                                        not
                                        necessarily sour (most sold at this bakery aren't).<br><br>
                                        The leaven culture contributes a living host of yeasts and bacteria that work
                                        chemical
                                        wonders in the dough. Bacterial fermentation breaks down flour, unlocks
                                        nutrients, and
                                        lends a unique flavor to the dough. The yeasts live symbiotically with the
                                        bacteria and
                                        generate gasses that raise or “leaven” the dough.<br><br>
                                        During the fermentation
                                        process, bacteria in the starter produce lactic acid (floral and mild) and
                                        acetic acid
                                        (vinegary and tangy). The fermentation technique used here favors the milder
                                        lactic
                                        acid.
